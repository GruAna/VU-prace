Ground truth (GT)

Frequently, not the character accuracy, but the Character Error
Rate (CER) is used. CER is the inverted accuracy, and defined as
CER = (i + s + d) / n, where n is the total number of characters, i the
minimal number of character insertions, s the substitutions and d
the deletions required to transform the reference text into the OCR
output.6
[16] propose an “end-to-end measure” which is based on
the CER, but with alignment between GT and OCR results in a way
that makes it configurable whether differences in the reading order
or the over-/under-segmentation of text lines are penalized.
