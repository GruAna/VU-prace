This paper is aimed at optical character recognition and focuses on comparison of different methods that are used in this branch of image processing. The goal of the paper is to test selected methods with various parameters on different datasets. One of the datasets includes historical posters from Vienna City Library. This dataset needed to be selected from a broad database of posters and manually labeled.

In the first chapter I introduced terms used in optical image recognition and described main tasks -- text detection and recognition. This is followed by a brief description of the structure of text image data accompanied by commonly used dataset examples.

The next chapter is dedicated to neural networks, which play a leading role in image recognition and in reading text tasks. I proceed from the basic network architecture to more complex networks that were developed for image and text recognition.

In the third chapter is a description of four selected methods I had chosen as methods to be tested for the purpose of this paper.

The last chapter is about performed experiments. It includes information of selected datasets, a description of implemented functions and above all a discussion about results obtained in the experiments.
