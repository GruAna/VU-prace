\chapter{OCR}

Optical character recognition (OCR) is a branch of digital image processing. Its aim is to detect and convert a text on an image into a machine-readable text. This discipline can be devided into three similar, yet different tasks: reading text on scanned printed documents, reading of handwritten texts and scene text recognition (also called text in the wild). The first task is very well developed, first successful results date back to the second half twentieth and were used in commercial sector \cite{ocrhist}. If we assume the handwritten text is on scanned single colored paper or created using a digital pen and that it was written legibly and without omitting letters in words due to fast writing, then recognition is similar to printed documents. The last task -- scene text recognition (STR) is the most challenging one.
