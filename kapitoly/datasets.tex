\subsection*{KAIST Scene Text Database}

This dataset contains 3000 images of photographed text. It can be divided into three major catgories -- text of Korean language, English language and mixed languages. As I concentrate on text in latin script in this paper further information relates to the English language dataset. The number of images is then reduced to less than four hundred images. Photographed objects are mostly shop banners or parts of magazine front pages. Photographs were either taken by a high-resolution digital camera or a low-resolution mobile phone camera.\ref{KAIST} Each photography has a ground truth description and a bitmap image. In the bitmap file only text is highlighted (by white or red color) and everything else apart from text is set as black. Ground truth files are in XML format and includes a name of an image, its resolution and bounding box for each word and also a bounding box for each letter of the word.

To use this dataset for testing and training the XML ground truth needed to be converted to string and int values. I wrote a parser, that combines letters to form a word that is within a given bounding box. I changed the notation of bounding boxes from one coordinate, width and height attributes to two top left and bottom right coordinates.

Unfortunately this dataset has few errors in filenames of corresponding files or in the content of XML files. Usually these are only typos, however they prevent automatic preprocessing of dataset. Due to this problem these mistakes need to be found and  manually corrected. Also there is a small number of ground truth XML file with fully missing data. 
Despite these shortcomings this dataset is useful because of the bitmap files. This allows to compare results of both images affected by shooting conditions and images dependent only on font and position.
